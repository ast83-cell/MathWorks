            Sol: (i)H, (ii)Cl, (iii)Ca, (iv)O, (v)Fe
            <br>
            <br>
            Q5: What is a Chemical formula?
            <br>
            Sol: The chemical formula of a substance is based on the composition of that substance.
            It indicates the type and number of atoms of each kind.
            <br>
            <br>
            Q6: Write the names of the following symbols:
            <br>

            <br>
            Sol: Many substances are made up of positively and negatively charged particles called ions.
            <br>
            <br>
            Q8: Write the following ions?

            <br>
            (i)Sodium Carbonate, (ii)Pottasium Nitrate, (iii)Magnesium Oxide
            <br>
            Sol: (i)Na₂CO₃, (ii)KNO3, (iii)MgO       
            <br>
            <br>
            Q10: What is a chemical equation?
            <br>
            Sol: The representation of a reaction using symbols and formulae of substances involved in a reaction is called a chemical equation.
            <br>
            <br>
            Q11: What is a combination reaction.Give one example?
            <br>
            Sol: A chemical reaction in which two or more substances(reactants) combine to form a 1 new substance called product is a called a combination reaction
            <br>
            eg: Mg + O2 → 2MgO   
            <br>
            <br>
            Q12: What is a decomposition reaction.Give one example?
            <br>
            Sol: A decomposition reaction can be defined as a chemical reaction in which one reactant breaks down into two or more products.
            <br>
            H2CO3 → H2O + CO2
            <br>
